# ADubhlaoich's dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles for the applications I use as my 'stack' on Linux. The folders are structured for use with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), which makes creating symlinks easy. Type `stow <folder>` within the repo folder to create a link in your home folder, `stow -D <folder>` to remove it and `stow -R <folder>` to do both.
